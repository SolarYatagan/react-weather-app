You need an API key from OpenWeatherMap, you can get one by creating an account on their website.
After you got your API key, create a (**.env**) file at root directory of project, copy the line below to the file and replace YOUR_KEY with your OpenWeatherMap API Key.

```
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

Then clone this repository, install dependencies and run the local server

```bash
cd reactweather
npm install
npm start
```

I used [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/ 'OpenWeatherMap') (Weather data API)
